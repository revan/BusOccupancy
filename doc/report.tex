\begin{abstract}
In this study we address the problem of programatically predicting bus occupancy.
We approach this in two ways: by using publicly available GPS positions to calculate stop time, and by using promiscuous Wi-Fi to count devices.
While the stop time approach proved unfruitful due to the significant time requirement in establishing a benchmark by which to interpret the data, the Wi-Fi approach yielded an accurate model once we compensated for noise.
We conclude by suggesting modifications to the experiment, and the application of this methodology to the determination of occupancy of other locales.

\section{Motivation}

\IEEEPARstart{D}{ue to}
the periodic nature of class schedules, students at Rutgers tend to move between campuses during certain known time intervals during the day.
This leads to predictable migratory patterns.
However, the bus schedule does a poor job of taking student schedules into account -- for example, on Livingston campus, buses on the route to College Avenue can often be found lined up at the stops consecutively, while the buses on the route to Busch are much rarer.
To make matters worse, the Busch buses are usually packed to capacity between class periods.
The aim of this project is to develop a system for better predicting the demand for buses, such that an empirical argument for the optimization of the bus schedule might be made.

%\section{Conclusion}
%	From the data above, we determined that the occupancy of a bus could be predicted by observing data traffic with some sensor placed on the bus.
%	We can filter out some of the irrelevant data by ignoring any signals below a certain strength.
%	This is the most feasible method, but requires external assistance with installation of devices.
