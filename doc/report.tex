\begin{abstract}
In this study we address the problem of programatically predicting bus occupancy.
We approach this in two ways: by using publicly available GPS positions to calculate stop time, and by using promiscuous Wi-Fi to count devices.
While the stop time approach proved unfruitful due to the significant time requirement in establishing a benchmark by which to interpret the data, the Wi-Fi approach yielded an accurate model once we compensated for noise.
We conclude by suggesting modifications to the experiment, and the application of this methodology to the determination of occupancy of other locales.

\section{Motivation}

\IEEEPARstart{D}{ue to} the periodic nature of class schedules, students at Rutgers tend to move between campuses during certain known time intervals during the day.
This leads to predictable migratory patterns.
However, the bus schedule does a poor job of taking student schedules into account -- for example, on Livingston campus, buses on the route to College Avenue can often be found lined up at the stops consecutively, while the buses on the route to Busch are much rarer.
To make matters worse, the Busch buses are usually packed to capacity between class periods.
The aim of this project is to develop a system for better predicting the demand for buses, such that an empirical argument for the optimization of the bus schedule might be made.

%\section{Conclusion}
%	From the data above, we determined that the occupancy of a bus could be predicted by observing data traffic with some sensor placed on the bus.
%	We can filter out some of the irrelevant data by ignoring any signals below a certain strength.
%	This is the most feasible method, but requires external assistance with installation of devices.

\appendix[Team Member Contributions]
Daniel Bordak
\begin{itemize}
\item Collected tcpdump and classroom data.
\item Created tcpdump output parser.
  Current implementation's design came from privacy concerns and speed requirements.
  Encountered difficulties in matching arbitrary MAC addresses and determining their type, as well as the aformentioned privacy concerns.
\item Optimized graph plotting functions for speed and maintainability.
  Usage of external libraries solved much of this.
  Integration of these libraries was particularly difficult, however, due to their demand of vectorized code.
\item Cowrote First-Last Grid Plot.
  Solved issues with axes.
\item Cowrote Segments Plot.
  Rewrote to better utilize Pandas features, dramatically increasing speed and accuracy.
\item Rewrote Unique Device Plot and Packet Plot to allow for different binsizes.
  Arbitrary binsizes led to later plot designs.
\item Wrote script to generate stop annotations, used on most plots.
  The desire to reduce redundancy led to the implementation of a common parser between both stop data and packet data.
\item Wrote sections of the report pertaining to the creation of plots.
  Difficulty encountered in remembering everything I did.% Heehee
\item Formatted report, including logfile syntax highlighting.
\end{itemize}
Erin Corrado
\begin{itemize}
\item Collected bus and classroom data
\item Cowrote First-Last Grid Plot.
  Difficulties in learning more advanced Python and learning how to utilize the Python libraries Numpy and Matplotlib.
\item Wrote length/occupancy correlation plot.
  Data was difficult to interpret at times.
  Data was time consuming to collect and limited.
\item Cowrote poster.
  Difficulty with trying to get the poster printed and transported to the proper place in time.
\item Cowrote Packet Histogram.
  Encountered difficulties with utilizing the new libraries used such as Pandas.
\item Proofread and edited report and graphs.
  Hardest part was keeping everyone's contributions in sync with one another.
  Also the group had to decide on style and formatting.
\end{itemize}

\item [Wrote Proposal] \hfill \\
	Designed two-method approach, laying out plan for study. Written at 3:00AM of deadline while team slept; difficulty staying awake.
\item [Collected tcpdump data] \hfill \\
	First data collection of study, so needed to figure out which tool to use and how to use it, and how to put a wireless card in monitor mode.
\item [Wrote Raw Packet Plot] \hfill \\
	First plot of study, so needed to choose and learn tools (matplotlib, numpy). Also needed to write annotation script and parser for tcpdump output, including a regex for matching MAC, as this was before Dan's rewrite.
\item [Wrote Unique Device Plot] \hfill \\
	First data processing of study. Later plots drew from this one.
\item [Cowrote Segments Plot] \hfill \\
	This was after Dan's refactoring, so needed to situate myself and learn the more efficient looping techniques.
\item [Wrote Vector Plot] \hfill \\
	Need to create and sum vectors from the data caused this plot to be significantly different.
\item [Wrote Report] \hfill \\
	Wrote entirety of report as first submitted.
