\begin{abstract}
In this study we address the problem of programatically predicting bus occupancy.
We approach this in two ways: by using publicly available GPS positions to calculate stop time, and by using promiscuous Wi-Fi to count devices.
While the stop time approach proved unfruitful due to the significant time requirement in establishing a benchmark by which to interpret the data, the Wi-Fi approach yielded an accurate model once we compensated for noise.
We conclude by suggesting modifications to the experiment, and the application of this methodology to the determination of occupancy of other locales.

\section{Motivation}

\IEEEPARstart{D}{ue to} the periodic nature of class schedules, students at Rutgers tend to move between campuses during certain known time intervals during the day.
This leads to predictable migratory patterns.
However, the bus schedule does a poor job of taking student schedules into account --- for example, on Livingston campus, buses on the route to College Avenue can often be found lined up at the stops consecutively, while the buses on the route to Busch are much rarer.
To make matters worse, the Busch buses are usually packed to capacity between class periods.
The aim of this project is to develop a system for better predicting the demand for buses, such that an empirical argument for the optimization of the bus schedule might be made.

The Rutgers bus system encompasses several routes between its campuses.
For the purpose of our study, we needed only to monitor one; conducting all collections on the same path is essential to producing comparable data.
We decided to monitor the $A$ route, one of the two routes connecting the Busch and College Avenue campuses ~\cite{busroutes}.
The other of the two routes, the $H$ route, was not selected due to its somewhat lower number of buses; it was easier for us to find $A$ buses whenever we needed to collect data.
The particular advantages of this route included its variety of locations: Busch and College Avenue offer a good contrast in terms of population, and thus device, density.
Additionally, the regularity of short buses improved our ability to collect data --- some Rutgers buses are of double length, making them harder for a single person to identify the number of passengers and the quantity of traffic on and off the bus.

Figures~\ref{fig:aroutebusch}-\ref{fig:aroutestadium} are maps of the stops serviced by the $A$ bus route.
We began riding the route on Busch Campus (Fig.~\ref{fig:aroutebusch}), at the Busch Campus Center.
It was too early to begin data collection there, however, so the first stop recognized in our dataset is the Buell Apartment stop, also on Busch.

\section{Alternative Application}
The methods we developed for the purpose of measuring bus occupancy can also be used for similar measurements in other settings.
To prove this, we measured occupancy in a classroom (Fig.~\ref{fig:probhmap}).
Just as with the bus data, the points around \(y=x\) consist of transient devices.
The points in the clump to the top right is probably due to a buildup of students outside the lecture hall awaiting the following class.
The points in the clump to the top left represent the devices that were present for the duration of the capture.
Other scattered points may be noise, but could also be sleeping devices which only report themselves occasionally.

There were exactly 106 students in the lecture hall during this collection.
While judging exact cutoffs for the measurement area is of a complexity outside the scope of this project, a rough estimate of the clump in the top left gives about 120 addresses.
In order to judge how reliable this count is, we created a new type of plot, counting the packets including each of these long-present devices (Fig.~\ref{fig:probhist}).
This plot shows that most devices measured transmitted or received a reasonable quantity of packets --- only a few are particularly low on packet count.
This suggests that this approach does generate an accurate count of the lecture hall occupancy.

We can also observe that some devices are involved in a significantly larger quantity of packets.
This graph is generated with router filtering on, meaning it is unlikely that these are routers.
% More observations here?

\section{Bus Occupancy: Discussion}

The Stop Length Inference approach supported correlations between the number of passengers on a bus and the length of time the bus stops.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical to utilize on a mass scale since collecting enough data to make conclusions about each stop would take an exorbitant amount of time and resources.
This approach may be possible with more people and time, but the time constraints make this method beyond the scope of this project.

The Promiscuous WiFi approach is much more efficient but has the problems of noise filtering and determining whether a device is actually present on the bus.
The methods that we used to analyze the WiFi data each had certain advantages and disadvantages.
The best way to use the data is to count the number of unique MAC addresses; the number of packets is not a reliable metric to determine the number of bus riders.
The First and Last time seen grid graphs reduce noise, but they do not represent the data in a fashion that is particularly easy to comprehend.
The Vector and Segment graphs are the most accurate in determining the number of bus occupants.
Both of these two graphs have specific sections where one is more accurate than the other.
Overall, the Vector and Segment approximations are the best way to analyze the data from the Promiscuous WiFi; therefore, these are the best approaches for predicting bus occupancy.
